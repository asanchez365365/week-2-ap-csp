# Step 1: Create Variables
# TODO: Replace the values below with your own info
first_name = "Marvin"
age = 30
favorite_color = "Blue"
favorite_number = 7

#  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase
print(first_name.upper())

# 2. Print how many letters are in your name
print(len(first_name))

# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message
print(f"{first_name} and {favorite_color}")

#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number
num1= 3
num2= 3
num3= int(input ("what is your 3rd fav")) #5
num4= int(input ("what is your 4th fav")) #4
print(num1 + num2) #output 6
print(num3 + num4) #output 54
