# Find 3 objects around the room and create variables from it,

m = "mouse"

k = "keyboard"

m1 = "monitor"
# Insert those variables into an f-string sentence(look at slide 22)in repl.it

print(f"In AP COMP I use a {m}, {k}, and {m1}.")

# Familiarize yourself with the syntax of the print() function.
# Print your name.
# Print today's date.
# Print the name of your favorite movie.

name = "joaquin"

date = "October 28"

movie = "maze runner"

print(name)
print(date)
print(movie)

# Print your name and age on separate lines using a single print() function.

name = "joaquin"
age = 17

print(f"Name: {name}\nAge: {age}")

# Use f-strings to print a message like: "In 10 years, [Your Name] will be [Your Age + 10] years old."

print(f"In 10 years, {name} will be {age + 10} years old")

#syntax is the way we write code
print("Hello World")
name = "John"
#in other languages, this is different
# in javascript for example, you define
#variables with let or const or var
#in python, you just give your variables a
#name and then define it with a value

# variable called blue_beetle_summary and print it it out to the screen

# print the length of the summary

#input is when we ask the user for input/data
# Ask the user to enter their name.

# Input Practice #1
# Write Python code that allows the user to enter their answer, by making them the following question:
# What are you learning today?
# Your code must be able to print to the screen whatever is entered by the user (use the print function).

learned_tdy = input("What are you learning today?")

print("You are learning:", learned_tdy)

# Input Practice #2
# Write Python code that allows the user to enter their answer, by making them the following question:
# Where are you from?

where_user_from = input("Where are you from?")

print("You are from:", where_user_from)

# Your code must be able to print to the screen whatever is entered by the user (use the print function).

# Input Practice #3
# Write Python code that displays the user's full name on the screen, by allowing them to enter their first and last name with the following instructions:
# What is your name?
# What is your surname?
# The code must be able to print the user's first and last name on the screen, separated by a space.

f_name = input("What is your first name? ")
l_name = input("What is your surname? ")

print("Your name is", (f_name), (l_name))

# Exercise:
# Write a program that asks the user for their name and favorite color, then prints a message using both pieces of information.
name = input("What is your name?")
color = input ("What is your favorite color?")

print("Your name is", (name), "and your favorite color is",(color))
